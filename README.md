# Welcome to TravelAPI!

TravelAPI is a Django server API specifically designed to enhance travel recommendations for trajects and plannings using advanced techniques like retrieval-augmented generation RAG. The primary goal of TravelAPI is to refine the language model (LLM), particularly leveraging OpenAI in our case, to provide users with highly specific and accurate recommendations for restaurants and hotels and activities to do in Morocco.

## Data:
We utilized two datasets:
- one for restaurants sourced from [Minister of Tourism and Agriculture](https://mtaess.gov.ma/fr/annuaires/annuaire-des-etablissements-dhebergements-touristique/)
- another for hotels from [Ministry of Agriculture](https://www.agriculture.gov.ma/sites/default/files/2021-09/annexe3_-_liste_des_restaurants_touristiques_independants_classes-_2018-.pdf)

## How It Works

- **Real-World Data**: TravelAPI relies on official data provided by the Minister of Tourism and Agriculture for restaurants and hotels. This data is transformed into a chroma format, creating a vector database using encoding techniques provided by OpenAI. This enables TravelAPI to effectively represent textual information numerically.
   
- **User Preferences**: Users provide their preferences such as budget, number of travelers, time constraints, and objectives to guide the recommendation process.
   
- **AI-Powered Framework**: TravelAPI leverages Langchain to provide the search response, which is then given to the OpenAI model GPT-3.5 Turbo to process the result with other fields in a JSON format such as activities, description, and food.
   
- **Enriched Responses**: The responses generated by TravelAPI are enriched with additional activities and detailed descriptions, enhancing the overall travel planning experience for users.
